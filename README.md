# Summary
Script Languages Assignment for Eszterhazy Karoly University. It is quite basic currently, my goal with this was to try and make a simple, playable game (in a script language), while using little help.
# Gameplay
It is rather straightforward, the player has to avoid the obstacles coming their way, they achieve that by jumping (pressing "space") at the right time. If the player fails to avoid an obstacle, the game is over. As time passes by, the obstacles will approach the player faster, thus the game will get harder and harder. The player's goal is survive for as long as possible, and to try and beat their own highscore.
